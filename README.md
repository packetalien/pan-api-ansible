# PAN-API Lab Resource Companion

This repository is a companion for the [Palo Alto Networks API Lab](http://api-lab.paloaltonetworks.com/).

It is designed for the Systems Engineering Lab in a Box. This repository should
contain files such as 'configs, example scripts, etc.'

# Differences in Lab in a Box v.s. Online/Cloud API LAB

* The configuration steps in cloud version are not identical to LIAB version.
* Cloud version of API lab is vWare, LIAB is L3
    * This will not impact the API lab
* Lab 4 will show users. The Cloud version has an adminr, LIAB will not have this.

Any questions contact the enablement team.
